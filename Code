('Alanis Morissette', '12/11/2025', '20:30', 'Born in Ottawa, Morissette had been a musician since a young age, joining Canadian kids show You Can’t Do That On Television in the 80s and releasing her debut single aged 10. Two albums followed in 1991 and 1992, both of which were popular in her homeland but struggled abroad.  That changed in 1994 when Morissette moved to LA and met producer and songwriter Glen Ballard. The two forged a solid partnership and steered Morissette away from the pop of her first two albums and towards a sound that married the angst, grit and confessionalism of alt-rock with giant pop hooks. Off the back of single You Oughta Know, Morissette was already a star by the time Jagged Little Pill hit record shelves in 1995.', 'SEC armadillo, Glasgow', 'Glasgow', '50', 'images/alanis.png', 'music'),

('Coldplay', '29/09/2025', '21:00', 'You’ll often hear Coldplay referred to as “unassuming” or “unlikely superstars”. And sure, if all you’d ever seen of them was a normal-looking guy in a waterproof jacket running around a beach and singing about yellow stars, it’s easy to see how you might come to that conclusion.  But all the above misses the point of Coldplay entirely. The simplicity yet enormity of the melodies and sentiments in their songs. The phenomenal energy of their live performances. Their single-minded devotion to connection on record and in person. Really, it was impossible for Coldplay to be anything other than superstars. It was all Yellow. Chris Martin (vocals, keys), Jonny Buckland (guitar), Will Champion (drums) and Guy Berryman (bass) formed Coldplay while studying together at UCL and a couple of early EPs earned them a deal with Parlophone and a rapidly growing reputation in the UK music press.', 'O2 Academy, Glasgow', 'Glasgow', '60', 'images/coldplay.jpg', 'music'),

Provide me with a collectible item script for my 3D Unity game.  When the player touches the item, It should increase the collectible count in another script (CollectiblesManager) then play a sound and disappear.  

Provide me with a Unity script for managing collectible items.  It should display the number of collectible items (crystals) found out of 7, starting at 0 using text mesh pro.  Then when 7 collectibles are found, the background music plus the wind audio should stop and then trigger a victory panel with different audio.  The game should also pause.

Write a script for my 3D unity game for managing an intro panel.  The intro panel manager should reference the main menu panel and menu camera which will initially be active.  Reference the first person player and the collectibles UI canvas which will only display when the start game button is clicked and ensure the menu panel and camera is not displaying when the start button is clicked.
